1. This is the First game i have ever finished to a somewhat playable state
2. This is the First time voice acting / drawing pixel art (except for the 4 poses, Walking and Oiling of the player)
	a. I drew the poses, walking and oiling for a game i never made 4 years ago.
3. The music was created by a guy on fiverr and i have all rights on it. The music is not used only for this game.
4. This is the first time using Godot.

# Gameplay
- You witness a girl being robbed and can choose between punching the robber or stripping.
- Punching leads to you being shot.
- Stripping leads to the game starting.
- Health bars are based on self esteem and you win the game by beating other people in bodybuilding battles.
- The Goal is to reach level 20. That is the max level and show that you have accepted your body.
- The people around you slowly become visible as you level up and once they are revealed will motivate you.
- The enemies will pose with you after you won.
- The girl is cool.


# Contribution
- After the acerola game jam, feel free to contribute to this game in order to make it good.
- There were a lot of features I couldnt implement due to time constraints and left placeholders for.
